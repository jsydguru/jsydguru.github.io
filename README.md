# jsyd-guru

This project was built for Jennie Brantley: Your Friendly Guru.
Check out how she can help your small business navigate the ever changing world of technology [here](www.jsyd.guru).

## Build & development

If this is the first time you're opening the project you'll need to run the following command first: `npm install`. Once npm has installed you're good to go! You won't have to run this again unless you deleted and downloaded the project again.

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
* If you see an error about grunt not being installed run the following command: `npm install -g grunt-cli`

To see a list of styles available visit: [www.jsyd.guru/#/style](www.jsyd.guru/#/style) or add "/style" to the end of your locally running site.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
